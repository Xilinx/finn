The model used here was a relatively simple model which could be fully built in a few minutes. However, this build flow would work for any model which was built with the FINN compiler with the additional steps applied - the generated `.xo` files simply need to be copied to their respective locations in the Vitis IP directory, and then the `make` steps can be run to build and run the instrumentation wrapper."

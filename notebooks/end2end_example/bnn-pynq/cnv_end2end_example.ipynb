    "The particular quantized neural network (QNN) we will be targeting in this notebook is referred to as CNV-w1a1 and it classifies 32x32 RGB images into one of ten CIFAR-10 classes. All weights and activations in this network are quantized to bipolar values (either -1 or +1), with the exception of the input (which is RGB with 8 bits per channel) and the final output (which is 32-bit numbers). It first appeared in the original [FINN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07119) from ISFPGA'17 with the name CNV, as a variant of the binarized convolutional network from the [BinaryNet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02830), in turn inspired by the VGG-11 topology which was the runner-up for the 2014 [ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/).\n",

You can read more about the sliding window operator and how convolution lowering works [in this notebook](https://github.com/maltanar/qnn-inference-examples/blob/master/3-convolutional-binarized-gtsrb.ipynb). The streaming dataflow architecture we will end up with is going to look something like this figure from the [FINN-R paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04570):\n",

    "\n",
    "Note how the convolution layer looks very similar to the fully connected one in terms of the matrix-vector-threshold unit (MVTU), but now the MVTU is preceded by a sliding window unit that produces the matrix from the input image. All of these building blocks, including the `MaxPool` layer you see in this figure, exist as templated Vitis HLS C++ functions in [finn-hlslib](https://github.com/Xilinx/finn-hlslib).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To target this kind of hardware architecture with our network we'll apply a convolution lowering transformation, in addition to streamlining. You may recall the *streamlining transformation* that we applied to the TFC-w1a1 network, which is a series of mathematical simplifications that allow us to get rid of floating point scaling operations by implementing few-bit activations as thresholding operations. \n",

NCHW means the tensor dimensions are ordered as `(N : batch, H : height, W : width, C : channels)` (assuming 2D images). The ONNX standard ops normally use the NCHW layout, but the ONNX intermediate representation itself does not dictate any data layout.\n",

The only operator left outside the FPGA partition was a `Transpose` to convert NCHW images into NHWC ones. Thus, we can skip the execution in the parent as long as we ensure our image has the expected data layout. The example numpy array can then be saved as .npy file."

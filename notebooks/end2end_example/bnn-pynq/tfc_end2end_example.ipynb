For image classification networks, this may include conversion of raw 8-bit RGB values into floating point values between 0 and 1. Similarly, at the output of the network some postprocessing may be performed during deployment, such as extracting the indices of the classifications with the largest value (top-K indices).\n",

We can achieve the same effect in FINN by exporting a single-node ONNX graph for division by 255 (which already exists as `finn.util.pytorch.ToTensor` and merging this with our original model.

    "First we extract the `remote_exec_model` again and pass it to the function. The function returns the metrics of the network as dictionary. "

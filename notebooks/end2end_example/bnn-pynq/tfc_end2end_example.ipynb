    "In many cases, it's common to apply some preprocessing to the raw data in a machine learning framework prior to training. For image classification networks, this may include conversion of raw 8-bit RGB values into floating point values between 0 and 1. Similarly, at the output of the network some postprocessing may be performed during deployment, such as extracting the indices of the classifications with the largest value (top-K indices).\n",

Brevitas preprocesses BNN-PYNQ network inputs with `torchvision.transforms.ToTensor()` [prior to training](https://github.com/Xilinx/brevitas/blob/master/brevitas_examples/bnn_pynq/trainer.py#L85), which converts 8-bit RGB values into floats between 0 and 1 by dividing the input by 255. We can achieve the same effect in FINN by exporting a single-node ONNX graph for division by 255 (which already exists as `finn.util.pytorch.ToTensor` and merging this with our original model. Finally, we're going to mark our input tensor as 8-bit to let FINN know which level of precision to use."

    "In addition to the functional verification, FINN also offers the possibility to measure the network performance directly on the PYNQ board. This can be done using the core function `throughput_test`. In the next section we import the function and execute it.\n",
    "First we extract the `remote_exec_model` again and pass it to the function. The function returns the metrics of the network as dictionary. "

    "In this notebook, we'll use the FINN compiler generate an FPGA accelerator with a streaming dataflow architecture from our quantized MLP for the cybersecurity task. The key idea in such architectures is to parallelize across layers as well as within layers by dedicating a proportionate amount of compute resources to each layer, illustrated on the figure to the left. You can read more about the general concept in the [FINN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.07119) and [FINN-R](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3242897) papers. This is done by mapping each layer to a Vivado HLS description, parallelizing each layer's implementation to the appropriate degree and using on-chip FIFOs to link up the layers to create the full accelerator.\n",
    "\n",
    "These implementations offer a good balance of performance and flexibility, but building them by hand is difficult and time-consuming. This is where the FINN compiler comes in: it can build streaming dataflow accelerators from an ONNX description to match the desired throughput."

    "Since version 0.5b, the FINN compiler has a `build_dataflow` tool. Compared to previous versions which required setting up all the needed transformations in a Python script, it makes experimenting with dataflow architecture generation easier. The core idea is to specify the relevant build info as a configuration `dict`, which invokes all the necessary steps to make the dataflow build happen. It can be invoked either from the [command line](https://finn-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_line.html) or with a single Python function call.\n",

The configuration is a Python [`dataclass`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) which can be serialized into or de-serialized from JSON files for persistence, although we'll just set it up in Python here.\n",
    "There are many options in the configuration to customize different aspects of the build, we'll only cover a few of them in this notebook. You can read the details on all the config options on [the FINN API documentation](https://finn-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source_code/finn.builder.html#finn.builder.build_dataflow_config.DataflowBuildConfig).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Output Products <a id=\"output_prod\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The build can produce many different outputs, and some of them can take a long time (e.g. bitfile synthesis for a large network). When you first start working on generating a new accelerator and exploring the different performance options, you may not want to go all the way to a bitfile. Thus, in the beginning you may just select the estimate reports as the output products. Gradually, you can generate the output products from later stages until you are happy enough with the design to build the full accelerator integrated into a shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output products are controlled by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `generate_outputs`: list of output products (of type [`finn.builder.build_dataflow_config.DataflowOutputType`](https://finn-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source_code/finn.builder.html#finn.builder.build_dataflow_config.DataflowOutputType)) that will be generated by the build. Some available options are:\n",
    "    - `ESTIMATE_REPORTS` : report expected resources and performance per layer and for the whole network without any synthesis\n",
    "    - `STITCHED_IP` : create a stream-in stream-out IP design that can be integrated into other Vivado IPI or RTL designs\n",
    "    - `RTLSIM_PERFORMANCE` : use PyVerilator to do a performance/latency test of the `STITCHED_IP` design\n",
    "    - `OOC_SYNTH` : run out-of-context synthesis (just the accelerator itself, without any system surrounding it) on the `STITCHED_IP` design to get post-synthesis FPGA resources and achievable clock frequency\n",
    "    - `BITFILE` : integrate the accelerator into a shell to produce a standalone bitfile\n",
    "    - `PYNQ_DRIVER` : generate a PYNQ Python driver that can be used to launch the accelerator\n",
    "    - `DEPLOYMENT_PACKAGE` : create a folder with the `BITFILE` and `PYNQ_DRIVER` outputs, ready to be copied to the target FPGA platform.\n",
    "* `output_dir`: the directory where all the generated build outputs above will be written into.\n",
    "* `steps`: list of predefined (or custom) build steps FINN will go through. Use `build_dataflow_config.estimate_only_dataflow_steps` to execute only the steps needed for estimation (without any synthesis), and the `build_dataflow_config.default_build_dataflow_steps` otherwise (which is the default value). You can find the list of default steps [here](https://finn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source_code/finn.builder.html#finn.builder.build_dataflow_config.default_build_dataflow_steps) in the documentation.\n",

    "* `fpga_part`: Xilinx FPGA part to be used for synthesis, can be left unspecified to be inferred from `board` below, or specified explicitly for e.g. out-of-context synthesis.\n",
    "* `board`: target Xilinx Zynq or Alveo board for generating accelerators integrated into a shell. See the `pynq_part_map` and `alveo_part_map` dicts in [this file](https://github.com/Xilinx/finn-base/blob/dev/src/finn/util/basic.py#L41) for a list of possible boards.\n",
    "* `shell_flow_type`: the target [shell flow type](https://finn-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source_code/finn.builder.html#finn.builder.build_dataflow_config.ShellFlowType), only needed for generating full bitfiles where the FINN design is integrated into a shell (so only needed if `BITFILE` is selected) \n",

    "### Configuring the Performance <a id=\"config_perf\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can configure the performance (and correspondingly, the FPGA resource footprint) of the generated dataflow accelerator in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) (basic) Set a target performance and let the compiler figure out the per-node parallelization settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) (advanced) Specify a separate .json as `folding_config_file` that lists the degree of parallelization (as well as other hardware options) for each layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook only deals with the basic approach, for which you need to set up:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `target_fps`: target inference performance in frames per second. Note that target may not be achievable due to specific layer constraints, or due to resource limitations of the FPGA. \n",
    "* `synth_clk_period_ns`: target clock frequency (in nanoseconds) for Vivado synthesis. e.g. `synth_clk_period_ns=5.0` will target a 200 MHz clock. Note that the target clock period may not be achievable depending on the FPGA part and design complexity."

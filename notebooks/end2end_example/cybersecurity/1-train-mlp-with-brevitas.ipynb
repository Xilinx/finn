This may be achieved by a mix of techniques, and machine-learning (ML) based techniques are increasing in popularity. \n",

    "The [UNSW-NB15](https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/unsw-canberra-cyber/cybersecurity/ADFA-NB15-Datasets/) is one such dataset created by the Australian Centre for Cyber Security (ACCS) to provide a comprehensive network based data set which can reflect modern network traffic scenarios. You can find more details about the dataset on [its homepage](https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/unsw-canberra-cyber/cybersecurity/ADFA-NB15-Datasets/).\n",

    "*Performance considerations:* FPGAs are commonly used for implementing high-performance packet processing systems that still provide a degree of programmability. To avoid introducing bottlenecks on the network, the DNN implementation must be capable of detecting malicious ones at line rate, which can be millions of packets per second, and is expected to increase further as next-generation networking solutions provide increased\n",

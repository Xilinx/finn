This may be achieved by a mix of techniques, and machine-learning (ML) based techniques are increasing in popularity. \n",

The conversion of the FINN-ONNX format is a FINN compiler transformation and to be able to apply it to our model, we will need to wrap it into [ModelWrapper](https://finn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/internals.html#modelwrapper). This is a wrapper around the ONNX model which provides several helper functions to make it easier to work with the model. Then we can call the conversion function to obtain the model in FINN-ONNX format."

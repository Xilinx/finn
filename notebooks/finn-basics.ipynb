    "## What is FINN?\n",
    "\n",
    "'FINN' is colloquially used to refer to two separate but highly related things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The [FINN project](https://xilinx.github.io/finn/), which includes tools for training quantized neural networks such as [Brevitas](github.com/Xilinx/brevitas), the FINN compiler, and the [finn-hlslib](github.com/Xilinx/finn-hlslib) Vivado HLS library of FPGA components for QNNs.\n",
    "* This repository, referred to as the *FINN compiler*, which is the centerpiece of the FINN project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use the FINN compiler?\n",
    "\n",
    "The FINN compiler should not be thought of a single pushbutton tool that does everything for you, but rather as a collection of scripts/tools that will help you convert a QNN into a custom FPGA accelerator that performs high-performance inference. We do provide several examples of taking trained networks all the way down to FPGA bitfiles, but if you are trying to do this for custom networks you will have to write your own Python scripts that call the appropriate FINN Compiler functions that process your design correctly, or adding new functions as required."

    "## Running FINN with Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Docker extensively for developing and deploying FINN. If you are not familiar with Docker, there are many excellent [online resources]( https://docker-curriculum.com/) to get started. There is a Dockerfile in the root of the repository, as well as a `run-docker.sh` script that can be launched in the following modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting an interactive shell for development or experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply running `sh run-docker.sh` without any additional arguments will clone the dependency repos, create a Docker container and give you a terminal with you can use for development for experimentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Important:* the Docker container is spawned with the `--rm` option, so make sure that any important files you created inside the container are either in the /workspace/finn folder (which is mounted from the host cinoyter) or otherwise backed up.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Develop from host, run inside container:* The FINN repository directory will be mounted from the host, so that you can use a text editor on your host computer to develop and the changes will be reflected directly inside the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh run-docker.sh notebook```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will launch the Jupyter notebook server inside a Docker container, and print a link on the terminal that you can open in your browser to run the FINN notebooks or create new ones. The link will look something like this (the token you get will be different):\n",

    "`http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=f5c6bd32ae93ec103a88152214baedff4ce1850d81065bfc`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `run-docker.sh` script forwards ports 8888 for Jupyter and 8081 for Netron, and launches the notebook server with appropriate arguments.\n",

    "FINN comes with a set of tests which you can easily launch in Docker as follows:\n",

    "## Intermediate Representation: FINN-ONNX\n",
    "\n",
    "FINN uses [ONNX](onnx.ai) as an intermediate representation (IR) for neural networks. As such, almost every component inside FINN uses ONNX and its [Python API](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/PythonAPIOverview.md), so you may want to familiarize yourself with how ONNX represents DNNs. Specifically, the [ONNX protobuf description](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/onnx/onnx.proto) (or its [human-readable documentation](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/IR.md) and the [operator schemas](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/Operators.md)  are useful as reference documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "FINN uses ONNX is a specific way that we refer to as FINN-ONNX, and not all ONNX graphs are supported by FINN (and vice versa). Here is a list of key points to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Custom quantization annotations but data stored as float.* ONNX does not support datatypes smaller than 8-bit integers, whereas in FINN we are interested in smaller integers down to ternary and bipolar. To make this work, FINN uses the `quantization_annotation` field in ONNX to annotate tensors with their [FINN DataType](https://github.com/Xilinx/finn/blob/dev/src/finn/core/datatype.py) information. However, all tensors are expected to use single-precision floating point (float32) storage in FINN. This means we store even a 1-bit value as floating point for the purposes of representation. The FINN compiler flow is responsible for eventually producing a packed representation for the target hardware, where the 1-bit is actually stored as 1-bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Custom operations/nodes.* FINN uses many custom operations (`op_type` in ONNX NodeProto) that are not defined in the ONNX operator schema. These custom nodes are marked with `domain=\"finn\"` in the protobuf to identify them as such. These nodes can represent specific operations that we need for low-bit networks, or operations that are specific to a particular hardware backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Custom ONNX execution flow* To verify correct operation of FINN-ONNX graphs, FINN provides its own [ONNX execution flow](https://github.com/Xilinx/finn/blob/dev/src/finn/core/onnx_exec.py). This flow supports the standard set of ONNX operations as well as the custom FINN operations.  *Important:* this execution flow is *only* meant for checking the correctness of models after applying transformations, and *not* for high performance inference. \n",
    "\n",
    "* *ModelWrapper* FINN provides a [`ModelWrapper`](https://github.com/Xilinx/finn/blob/dev/src/finn/core/modelwrapper.py) class as a thin wrapper around ONNX to make it easier to analyze and manipulate ONNX graphs. This wrapper provides many helper functions, while still giving full access to the ONNX protobuf representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Netron](https://lutzroeder.github.io/netron/) is very useful for visualizing ONNX models, including FINN-ONNX models."

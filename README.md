# Dataflow Compiler for Fast, Scalable Quantized Neural Network Inference on FPGAs

**FINN+** is a fork of **FINN**, an experimental framework from Integrated Communications and AI Lab of AMD Research & Advanced Development to explore deep neural network inference on FPGAs.
It specifically targets quantized neural networks, with emphasis on generating dataflow-style architectures customized for each network.
The resulting FPGA accelerators are highly efficient and can yield high throughput and low latency.
The framework is fully open-source in order to give a higher degree of flexibility, and is intended to enable neural network research spanning several layers of the software/hardware abstraction stack.

**For the time being, we refer to the original project [webpage](https://xilinx.github.io/finn/) for further information and documentation.**

## FINN+ Extensions
**FINN+** aims to incorporate all development from the upstream repository (dev branch) while extending **FINN** in all directions, including the following list of features that are either in progress or already completed:
- Transformer/Attention support
- Improved streamlining
- Improved automatic folding and FIFO-sizing
- Empirical quality-of-result (QoR) estimation
- Back-end extensions
    - Instrumentation for accurate performance profiling in simulation and on hardware
    - Improved Alveo build flow
    - Multi-FPGA support
    - Optimized C++ driver
- Quality-of-live improvements
    - Better logging and error handling
    - Type hinting/checking
    - Alternative YAML-based build configuration
    - Containerless setup

Please refer to our [**Feature Tracker**](https://github.com/orgs/eki-project/projects/1) for the current status of individual features.
While some items are already on-track to be merged into the upstream repository, we try to merge them into the **FINN+** dev branch as early as possible to increase development pace and drive our research forward.

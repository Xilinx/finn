    the activations.
    If incompatibilities are found a ValueError or RuntimeError is raised.

    The optional keyword argument `filter_function`
    presents a way to control which Quant and BipolarQuant nodes in the activation path
    are converted to MultiThreshold nodes. A warning will be emitted when a Quant node
    is not converted to a MultiThreshold node.

    :param filter_function: Each candidate Quant and BinaryQant node is first evaluated
    by this function. If the function returns False,
    then the node is not converted to a MultiTrheshold node.
    The function is given the model and candidate node as parameters.
    Per default a filter function is inserted, which disables the conversion of
    Quant nodes, which have a bit width of larger than 8.

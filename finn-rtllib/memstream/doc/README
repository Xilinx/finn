Memory Streamer Address Map

The memory streamer implements an internal storage array of parameters:
Memory Depth: D
Memory Width: W

When W is greater than 32, the bits of each word are assigned to N
32-bit words on the AXI interface, where:
N = pow(2,ceil(log2(W/32)))

To the AXI master, this memory appears to have the following parameters:
Apparent Memory Depth: D*N
Apparent Memory Width: 32b

To perform a write, the AXI master must write to the N 32-bit segments
corresponding to a streamer memory word. The writes are committed to
the internal memory when the last segment of a word is written.
The order of writes to the other segments does not matter.
To perform a read, the AXI master simply indicates on 32-bit segment to read.

Example: D=2, W=70

Here N=2 so we allocate two 32-bit words in the global memory map for each
physical memory word:

AXI Addr | Internal position of data
------------------------------------
0        | mem[0][31: 0]
4        | mem[0][63:32]
8        | mem[0][69:64]
C        | N/A
10       | mem[1][31: 0]
14       | mem[1][63:32]
18       | mem[1][69:64]
1C       | N/A

To perform a write to mem[0], the AXI master writes to AXI Addr 0,4,8 in any
order, then writes to AXI Addr 0xC to commit the write. To read mem[1][63:32],
the AXI master reads from AXI Addr 0x14. The words of mem can be written to or 
read from in any order.

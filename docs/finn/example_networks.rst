Example Networks
****************

FINN uses `several pre-trained QNNs <https://github.com/Xilinx/brevitas/tree/master/brevitas_examples/bnn_pynq>`_
that serve as examples and testcases.

* TFC, SFC, LFC... are fully-connected networks trained on the MNIST dataset
* CNV is a convolutional network trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset
* w\_a\_ refers to the quantization used for the weights (w) and activations (a) in bits

These networks are built end-to-end as part of the `FINN integration tests <https://github.com/Xilinx/finn/blob/master/tests/end2end/test_end2end_bnn_pynq.py>`_ ,
and the key performance indicators (FPGA resource, frames per second...) are
automatically posted to the dashboard below.
To implement a new network, you can use the `integration test code <https://github.com/Xilinx/finn/blob/dev/tests/end2end/test_end2end_bnn_pynq.py>`_
as a starting point, as well as the `relevant Jupyter notebooks
<https://github.com/Xilinx/finn/tree/master/notebooks/end2end_example>`_.

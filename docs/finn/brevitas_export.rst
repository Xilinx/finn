FINN expects an ONNX model as input. This can be a model trained with `Brevitas <https://github.com/Xilinx/brevitas>`_. Brevitas is a PyTorch library for quantization-aware training and the FINN Docker image comes with several `example Brevitas networks <https://github.com/Xilinx/brevitas/tree/master/brevitas_examples/bnn_pynq>`_. Brevitas provides an export of a quantized network in ONNX representation. The resulting model consists only of `ONNX standard nodes <https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/Operators.md>`_, but also contains additional attributes for the ONNX nodes to represent low precision datatypes. To work with the model it is wrapped into :ref:`modelwrapper` provided by FINN.

At this stage we can already use the functional verification flow to simulate the model using Python, this is marked in the graphic with the dotted arrow. For more details please have look at :ref:`verification`.

The model can now be further processed in FINN, the next flow step is :ref:`nw_prep`.
